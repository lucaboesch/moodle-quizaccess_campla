  Scenario: Configure the CAMPLA quiz access rule URL and secret
    Given I log in as "admin"
    And I navigate to "Plugins > Activity modules > Quiz > CAMPLA" in site administration
    And I set the field "CAMPLA basis URL" to "https://campla.moodle.org"
    And I set the field "CAMPLA secret" to "1UmPYTe3Th1_95"
